\section{Introduction}

This template took two hours to make... Well, it's done now. And it looks pretty good. Rev\TeX is really annoying in how it throws a warning for no reason. It be like that sometimes, it really do. This first page has a few example stuff that might be useful to copy and paste.

\subsection{Example Stuff from NGRD}

Below is a formula.

\[\Delta\rho(r)=\rho(r)_{I}-\rho(r)_{M}-\rho(r)_{S}\]

And here is Table \ref{paw}.

\section{Objective}

% 2. OBJECTIVE: Briefly explain the goal of the experiment in your own words. It
% should detail how the goal will be met and what techniques will be utilized.

\section{Reaction Equations}

% 3. REACTION EQUATIONS: All reagents, products, and reaction conditions should
% be shown in a balanced equation. Do not include a reaction mechanism unless it is
% specifically requested by your TA. This section may be written-in by hand.

\section{Theoretical Yield}

% 4. THEORETICAL YIELD: Calculate your theoretical yield by way of the amount of
% limiting reagent, which should be specifically identified, actually used (i.e. if your
% protocol says to use 0.50g of benzil, your limiting reagent, and you measure out
% 0.49g of benzil, use 0.49g to calculate theoretical yield). Show all your work. This
% section may also be written-in by hand.

\section{Procedure}

% 5. PROCEDURE: The procedure must be in your own words (do not just copy the
% protocol) and should be a short paragraph detailing the general order of operations.

\section{Observations}

% 6. OBSERVATIONS: What you actually did in lab and what you observed (color
% changes, etc). It should be written in third person past-tense (no “I”, “We”, or
% “They”). Deviations from the protocol and how any problems were corrected should
% also be noted.

\section{Characterization}

% 7. CHARACTERIZATION: Percent yield (may be hand-written, show all work), the
% physical description of the final product, and the results and analysis (purity,
% identification) of any characterization (melting-point, FTIR, NMR, TLC) should all
% be included in this section.

\section{Conclusion}

% 8. CONCLUSION: This section should include an analysis of the generated data,
% whether or not the results were as expected, and whether there were incidents during
% the experiment that could have had negative effects on the yield or purity of the
% product. Don’t repeat previous sections unless it is necessary for clarity.
